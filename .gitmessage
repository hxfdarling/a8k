# 代码提交需要统一 message 规范
# 运行 npm i -g commitizen
# 通过 git cz 命令交互式的输入提交信息
# example: git commit -m 'feat(all page): update components'
# head: <type>(<scope>): <subject>
# - type: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, style, revert
# - scope: can be empty (eg. if the change is a global or difficult to assign to a single component)
# - subject: start with verb (such as 'change'), 50-character line
#
# body: 72-character wrapped. This should answer:
# * Why was this change necessary?
# * How does it address the problem?
# * Are there any side effects?
#
# footer:
# - Include a link to the ticket, if any.
# - BREAKING CHANGE
#
